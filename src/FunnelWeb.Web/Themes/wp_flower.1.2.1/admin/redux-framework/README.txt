Redux is a simple, truly extensible and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Ships with an integrated demo.

== Description ==

Redux is a simple, truly extensible and fully responsive options framework for WordPress themes and plugins. Built on the WordPress Settings API, Redux supports a multitude of field types as well as custom error handling, custom field & validation types, and import/export functionality.

But what does Redux actually DO? We don't believe that theme and plugin
developers should have to reinvent the wheel every time they start work on a
project. Redux is designed to simplify the development cycle by providing a
streamlined, extensible framework for developers to build on. Through a
simple, well-documented config file, third-party developers can build out an
options panel limited only by their own imagination in a fraction of the time
it would take to build from the ground up!

= Online Demo =
Don't take our word for it, check out our online demo and try Redux without installing a thing!
[**http://demo.reduxframework.com/wp-admin/**](http://demo.reduxframework.com/wp-admin/)

= Use Our Custom Generator to Get Started =
Want to use Redux, but not sure what to do? Use our [generator](http://generate.reduxframework.com/)! It will allow you to make
a custom theme based on [_s](http://underscores.me), [TGM](http://tgmpluginactivation.com), and [Redux](http://reduxframework.com), and any Redux arguments you want to set.
Don't want to make your own theme? Then output a custom admin folder that you can place
in a theme or plugin. Oh and did we mention it's free? Try it today at:
[**http://generate.reduxframework.com/**](http://generate.reduxframework.com/)


= Docs & Support =
We have extremely extensive docs. Please visit [http://docs.reduxframework.com/](http://docs.reduxframework.com/) If that doesnâ€™t solve your concern, you should search [the issue tracker on Github](https://github.com/ReduxFramework/ReduxFramework/issues). If you can't locate any topics that pertain to your particular issue, [post a new issue](https://github.com/ReduxFramework/ReduxFramework/issues/new) for it. Before you submit an issue, please read [our contributing requirements](https://github.com/redux-framework/redux-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We build off of the dev version and push to WordPress.org when all is confirmed stable and ready for release.


= Redux Framework Needs Your Support =
It is hard to continue development and support for this free plugin without contributions from users like you. If you enjoy using Redux Framework, and find it useful, please consider [making a donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=N5AD7TSH8YA5U). Your donation will help encourage and support the plugin's continued development and better user support.

* Compiler integration! A custom hook runs when any fields with the argument `compile => true` are changed.
* Oh, and did we mention a fully integrated Google Webfonts setup that will make you so happy you'll want to cry?

              the panel. The effects have been seen up to 300% speed improvement. The only
              time a field will be initialized is if it's visible, thus reducing the processing
