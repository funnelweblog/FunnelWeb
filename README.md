# FunnelWeb

FunnelWeb is an open source blog engine, built by developers for developers. Instead of fancy quotes and oodles of widgets, we focus on letting you post beautiful code samples, keeping your markup clean and valid, and encouraging collaboration with rich comments. FunnelWeb is easy to install, and has an active community.

# Markdown

FunnelWeb is built on top of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is a HTML abstraction layer allowing you to author your articles in a clean text format which will be transformed to HTML for serving on your site.

For editing we recommend that you use [Downmarker](https://github.com/Code52/DownmarkerWPF) which is just like Windows Live Writer but for Markdown.

# Installing

Really we recommend that you grab the code from this repository and run the `build.bat` file. This will generate you an output that you can publish onto your server and run through the installer.

If you're not a fan of running bleeding edge software you can [download a stable build](http://hg.funnelweblog.com/release/downloads).

Lastly you need to modify the `my.config` file which contains your login information and SQL connection information.
